The machine will receive a number of 300 bits per clock and will provide the result on O such that: O = X mod P where P is a 256-bit prime number

ZK Proof Challenge

Build a machine with the following interface:
Input Clock (1b),
Input Reset (1b),
Input X (300b),
Output O (256b).

The machine will receive a number of 300 bits per clock and will provide the result on O such that: O = X mod P where P is a 256-bit prime number

P = 104899928942039473597645237135751317405745389583683433800060134911610808289117
